100% Vibe Coded AMD Hypervisor trying out Opus 4.6.

Tested with basic imgui internal menu for Apex Legends and worked.

Will probably end up nuking this in a few days since tbh its still actually pretty bad despite being "functional" if you could call it that.

Maybe Opus 5.0 will be cracked enough in the future for this.
